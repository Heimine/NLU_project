Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25å¡ latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 å¡C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 å¡C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32415,Where did the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) start in?,China,75,FALSE,"The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in China and devastated a vast majority of countries. In India, COVID-19 cases are steadily increasing since January 30, 2020, and the government-imposed lockdown across the country to curtail community transmission. COVID-19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID-19 in the coming days in India using an Auto-regression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richards model. By the end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020.

In the current context of high incidence rates of SARS-CoV2 in the community, a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial transmission is expected. The risk of nosocomial transmission could even be higher in low-income countries that have fragile healthcare systems. This protocol is intended to study and document suspected or confirmed cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk factors/protective) at participating hospitals. Methods and analysis: This will be an international multicentre prospective, observational, hospital-based study in adults and children. It will include volunteer patients, care givers and healthcare professionals in France and hospitals affiliated with the GABRIEL network. Demographic and clinical data will be collected using case-report forms designed especially for the purpose of the project. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected and tested for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR. Characteristics of the study participants, the proportion of confirmed nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infections relative to all patients with syndromes suggestive of 2019-nCoV infection will be analysed. Appropriate multivariate modelling will be used to identify the determinants associated with nosocomial onset. Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the clinical research and committee of Ile de France V on March 8, 2020.

According to the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index,1 22 of the 25 countries most susceptible to an infectious disease outbreak are in Africa. The high prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, and other pathogens might potentiate the severity of COVID-19 and contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. Health-care systems and human resources are already spread thin. And although the young age of the population (with more than half aged younger than 20 years) might prove protective, it also means that Africa has much to lose in terms of disability-adjusted life years. On Feb 27, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa was reported in Nigeria, making spread in the region more probable.2 While preparing a response to COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda, we read Jinnong Zhang and colleagues' work with great interest.3 We commend the authors for distilling complex information regarding triage and clinical care for patients who have a novel pathogen, for which there is little evidence, into a succinct flowchart. Unfortunately, many aspects of their algorithm would not be feasible in our setting.

This study analyzed the data from 310 regions across 116 countries that reported confirmed cases of Covid-19 by March 12, 2020, and found that temperature, humidity, and wind speed were inversely associated with the incidence rate of Covid-19 after adjusting for the regional and temporal trend in the incidence of Covid-19, columnar density of ozone, precipitation probability, sea-level air-pressure, and length of daytime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31408,What does more evidence suggest recently?,a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms,489,FALSE,"Background: Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. Results: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32475,What show a very sytable and very fitting conformational complex formation tendency with the Toll like receptor 3?,both the CTL and HTL MEVs models ,1826,FALSE,"AbstractThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19 / Wuhan coronavirus), officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 causes the contagious COVID19 disease also known as 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease and has led to the ongoing 2019ÛÒ20 pandemic COVID19 outbreak. The effective countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection requires the design and development of specific and effective vaccine candidate. In the present study we have screened 38 CTL, 42 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by molecular docking. The screened epitopes were further utilized to design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were prepared and validated for their stable molecular interaction with Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in Human cell line.

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database. Materials and Methods: We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model. Results: We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31008,How long can darunavir/cobicistat suspensions compounded by pharmacists using as active ingredient a commercially available tablet can be stable for at least?,one week,997,FALSE,"Abstract The COVID-19 outbreak is now one of the most critical crises to manage for most of the national healthcare systems in the world. In the absence of authorised pharmacological treatments, many antiretrovirals, including darunavir/cobicistat fixed combination, were used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, for most of them, the drug products available on the market are not designed to be administered by a nasogastric tube to inpatients of intensive care units. Therefore, their manipulation, even if it can strongly affect the product quality, is necessary for the preparation of suspension to meet patientsÛª need. In this situation, it is urgent to provide data and guidance to support hospital pharmacist and clinicians in their activity. The data in this article indicate that darunavir/cobicistat suspensions compounded by pharmacists using as active ingredient a commercially available tablet can be stable at least for one week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48429,Who are thought to be susceptible to the virus?,Neonates,525,FALSE,"Since December, 2019, a pneumonia of unknown cause, which has clinical manifestations similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome,1,2 originated in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread across China and to at least 23 countries. By Feb 5, 2020, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases had exceeded 20 000, with more than 400 deaths. About 100 children were affected, with the youngest being 30 h after birth. A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was considered to be the causative agent of this pneumonia. Neonates are thought to be susceptible to the virus because their immune system is not well developed, which is of great concern to neonatal medical service providers. Paediatricians and neonatologists belonging to the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders and Pediatric Committee of Medical Association of Chinese PeopleÛªs Liberation Army have contributed to the control efforts in China.

SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31422,What has this outbreak been tentatively associated with?,"a seafood market in Wuhan, China",191,FALSE,"AbstractThe ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32756,How many US hospital workers might get infected from COVID-19?,53640,1017,FALSE,"Objective: We estimated that how many hospital workers in the United States (US) might get infected or die in the COVID-19 pandemic. We also estimated the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) and age restrictions on these estimates. Methods: Our secondary analyses estimated hospital worker infections in the US based on health worker infection and death rates per 100 deaths from COVID-19 in Hubei and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged ä´ 60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID-19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high-risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy. Restricting hospital workers aged ä´ 60 years from direct patient care reduced counts to 1,985 (95% CI: 1,627 to 2,347) considering Hubei and to 2,002 (95% CI: 1,400 to 2,602) considering the Italian scenario. Conclusion: We estimated significant burden of illness due to COVID-19 if no strategies are adopted. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could have significant reductions in hospital worker infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32779,What may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication?,lung senescence ,163,FALSE,"AbstractCOVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32541,Where were most studies conducted in?,Asia,1220,FALSE,"Objectives: To examine the impact of providing healthcare during or after health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers (HCWs) mental health, and to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs. In light of the limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified in this study represent important targets for future interventions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32249,What can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs?,Modifications of the clear plastics,371,FALSE,"Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis.

We present here our experience with an initial seven cases of confirmed COVID-19 in pregnancy presenting to a single large New York City tertiary care hospital. Five of the seven patients presented with symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, myalgias, fevers, chest pain, and headache. Four patients were admitted to the hospital, including two who required supportive care with intravenous hydration. Most notably, the other two admitted patients were asymptomatic on admission to the hospital, presenting instead for obstetrically-indicated labor inductions; both of these patients became symptomatic post-partum, each requiring intensive care unit admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31898,How many patients has the recent pandemic of COVID-19 involved?,tens of thousands of patients,45,FALSE,"The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has involved tens of thousands of patients in numerous countries and the causative virus, SARS COV-2 is highly transmissible. Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, user-friendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard.

There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31926,What could this model provide?,more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control,1775,FALSE,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ 2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide with over 140,000 infected cases up to date. Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32296,What does the website corona-lab.ch provide?,an interactive simulation tool based on the presented model,2215,FALSE,"Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic.

Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33432,What are global health crises?,information crises,76,FALSE,"Abstract In this opinion paper, we argue that global health crises are also information crises.

Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32096,"Where was the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported?",in Wuhan of China,133,FALSE,"Due to the excessively high capability of human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan of China, has rapidly spread to the entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency. Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the effect of control measures on the transmission, is crucial to improving the national and international disease control effectiveness. We here propose a simple model based on the exponential infectious growth but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data and, we think, has largely captured the transmission pattern of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. Successful control measures, such as in China and South Korea, have resulted in an exponentially damping dynamics of the viral spread. Such exponential damping, therefore, could be used as a measure of control effectiveness, as also shown in the data of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide with the exponential damping yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32914,What were the most common clinical symptoms?,fever (89%) and dry cough (60%),881,FALSE,"Objectives: Investigate the characteristics and rules of hematology changes in patients with COVID-19, and explore the possibility to identify moderate and severe patients using conventional hematology parameters or combined parameters. Methods: The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively.

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with slower increase of the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for sars-cov-2 led to the upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive therapeutic strategy.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. By applying reverse vaccinology and machine learning, we predicted potential vaccine targets for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We then propose that an ""Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine"" containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31702,Since when did COVID-19 emerge in Wuhan city?,mid-December 2019,18,FALSE,"Background: Since mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases caused by a novel coronavirus, now designated COVID-19 by the WHO, emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts.

Objective The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. Results We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

To facilitate the evaluation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9-mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS-CoV-2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies. These peptides were derived from all 11 proteins spanning the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome, including peptides that have previously been validated experimentally.

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p < 0.01). Conclusions Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them.

A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model.

Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China. Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days). Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19. The longer emergency disposal period in the case of COVID-19 could be attributed to the government's slower response to the epidemic.

However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29257,What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,,,TRUE,"The UK government has released the scientific advice it has received on covid-19, and independent experts aren't impressed, reports Jessica Hamzelou",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31704,What symptoms were rare for COVID-19?,"dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis",610,FALSE,"Objective: To compare the difference between severe and non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and figure out the potential symptoms lead to severity. Methods: Articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google up-to 24 February 2020 were systematically reviewed. Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. Conclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26900,"As an academic journal, what we will continue to do?",quickly and transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19,830,FALSE,"Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients, and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible effectiveness of various interventions. This issue has rapidly reviewed and published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies.

Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear. Objective: To describe the clinical, laboratorial and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19. Data Sources: The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and March 30th 2020. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were: (1) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (2) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (3) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests or radiological examinations. Data Extraction: Number of cases, gender, age, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, radiological examinations and outcomes. Results: A total of 34 studies (1,118 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1,111 had their severity classified: 14.3% were asymptomatic, 36.4% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.2% were severe and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (16.3%), followed by cough (14.4%), nasal symptoms (3.6%), diarrhea (2.7%) and nausea/vomiting (2.5%). One hundred forty-five (12.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (3.8%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count were reported in 13.1% of cases. Abnormalities on computed tomography was reported in 62.7% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground glass opacities, patchy shadows and consolidations. Only one death was reported. Conclusions: Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adults cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
